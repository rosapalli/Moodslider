# Moodslider

The Sky Marketing team have asked Software Engineering to create a recommendations application which will enable customers 
to view content Sky has offer based on their mood. We have called this application ‘Moodslider’.
Your task is to create a web application that will display content based on what customers tell us they are in the mood for. 
Once they have made their selections, the application should recommend some content and display it on the page. 
In addition you will need to provide a feature that will enable content data to be uploaded. Your application should also be Sky branded.
